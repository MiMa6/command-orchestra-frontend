## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm package manager

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd command-orchestra-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```sh

```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

1. **Voice Commands**: Click the microphone button to start voice recognition, then speak your commands naturally (e.g., "start focus mode", "gym notes running")

2. **Manual Triggers**: Click on any automation card to trigger it manually

3. **Sub-modes**: Some automations like "GYM Notes" have sub-triggers for specific activities

## Development

### Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                # Utility functions and configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/              # Page components
â”œâ”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx           # Application entry point
```

### Key Components

- `VoiceControl` - Handles speech recognition and voice commands
- `AutomationTriggers` - Displays and manages automation cards
- `Header` - Application title and branding
- `StatusFooter` - Shows current system status

### Adding New Automations

To add a new automation mode:

1. Add the trigger definition to `automationTriggers` array in `src/pages/Index.tsx`
2. Implement the backend logic for the automation (if needed)
3. Add appropriate keywords for voice recognition
